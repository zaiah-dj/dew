- How does Webpack fit in?
		dunno yet


- coming along... just need to think about interaction between elements 
		(specifically sorting) 


- create works nicely, cover is not yet implemented


- some things to consider:
		talking to other things / components
		clean callbacks (specifically XHR and Timeout or Animation)	
		performance and memory (not sure how this is under load, but I doubt it's high)
		sort, etc. - implement these
		routing is not all that clean yet...
		DOM failures?
		sensible data structures (arrays for anything with multiple)

- to go:
		_.path( ... )
		_ as an accessible object within a listener...
		chain different components...
